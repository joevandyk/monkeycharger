MonkeyCharger is a small stand-alone RESTified Rails app that lets you store
and charge credit cards.  It uses the ActiveMerchant library for the 
authorizing and capturing of credit cards.

You probably want to run this application on a super-secured machine that's firewalled
like crazy and is not accessible from the internet.  And follow the Visa CISP 
documentation.
