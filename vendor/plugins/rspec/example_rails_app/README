This application contains various models, views, controllers, and helpers that are used
by the specs that specify the behaviour of RSpec on Rails.

It also contains example specs and code that can be used to help understand how to use
RSpec on Rails.

Note that all of the specs in ./spec and ./vendor/plugins/rspec/spec get run when running
rake pre_commit from this directory or from the RSpec project root.

Note also that the ./spec/spec_helper.rb file gets replaced when running rake pre_commit
from this directory or from the rspec project root.
