h2. Other Mock/Stub Frameworks

If you prefer to use a mocking framework other than RSpec's built in framework, you
can do this quite simply. RSpec currently supports use of the following frameworks
out of the box (in alphabetical order):

* "flexmock":http://flexmock.rubyforge.org/
* "mocha":http://mocha.rubyforge.org
* "rr":http://rubyforge.org/projects/pivotalrb/

RSpec supports use of a single framework per project, because these frameworks (including)
RSpec's own, tend to add methods to Object that might or might not work well together. To
choose a mock framework other than rspec, simply add the following to spec/spec_helper.rb
(or any file that gets loaded when you run your examples):

<ruby>
Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
  config.mock_with :rr
end
</ruby>

Valid options are <code>:flexmock</code>, <code>:mocha</code>, <code>:rspec</code> (of course),
and <code>:rr</code>.

h2. Even more "other" frameworks

If you have a different framework that is not supported directly by RSpec, you can easily
choose that framework instead by creating an adapter and telling RSpec where to find it.
Here is RSpec's own adapter as an example:

<ruby file="../rspec/plugins/mock_frameworks/rspec.rb"/>

This file must require any libraries or resources that implement the framework, and then define
a <code>Spec::Plugins::MockFramework</code> module with the following methods:

* <code>setup_mocks_for_rspec</code> is called before each example is run.
* <code>verify_mocks_for_rspec</code> is called after each example is run. Use this if you want
RSpec to automatically verify your mocks after each example. You must supply this method either
way, but you can leave it empty if your framework doesn't support auto-verification.
* <code>teardown_mocks_for_rspec</code> is guaranteed to be run after each example even when there
are errors. Use this to ensure that there is no state shared across example, clearing out changes
to static resources like class-level mock expectations, etc.

Once you have defined your adapter, you can then tell RSpec to use your adapter like so:

<ruby>
Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
  config.mock_with '/path/to/my/adapater.rb'
end
</ruby>
