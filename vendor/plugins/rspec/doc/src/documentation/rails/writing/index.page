h2. Introduction to Writing Examples using Spec::Rails

Spec::Rails supports 4 different types of Executable Examples:

* "Model Examples":models.html
* "View Examples":views.html
* "Controller Examples":controllers.html
* "Helper Examples":helpers.html

Each of these use specialized Behaviour subclasses to give you access to the appropriate
services and methods. The specific type of Behaviour is determined implicitly by placing the
examples in an appropriately named file (*_spec.rb) within an appropriately named directory: 

<pre>
spec/controllers/**/*_spec.rb
spec/helpers/**/*_spec.rb
spec/models/**/*_spec.rb
spec/views/**/*_spec.rb
</pre>

%{color:red;font-weight:bold}WARNING:% If you do not follow these conventions, you will not
get the correct Behaviour subclass. If you prefer to disregard this convention, you can
get the correct Behaviour subclass by passing a hash to the describe method:

<ruby>
describe "some model", :behaviour_type => :model do
  ...
end
</ruby>

This works with <code>:model, :view, :controller and :helper</code>.
