h2. Spec::Rails - Generators

Spec::Rails contains generators that you can use to generate models and RESTful controllers 
in a similar fashion to Rails' builtin generators. The only difference is that they generate specs instead 
of tests and fixtures will be put under the spec folder. Example:

<pre>
ruby script/generate rspec_scaffold purchase order_id:integer created_at:datetime amount:decimal
</pre>

or

<pre>
ruby script/generate rspec_model person
</pre>

or

<pre>
ruby script/generate rspec_controller person
</pre>

For more information on each generator, just run them without any arguments.
