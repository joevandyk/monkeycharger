h2. Rake Task

RSpec comes with a "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/ task for executing specs.
See "Spec::Rake::SpecTask":../../rdoc/classes/Spec/Rake/SpecTask.html API for details.

h3. Rake task example

This is a snippet from RSpec's own Rakefile. It creates a task to run the examples.

<ruby file="../rspec/rake_tasks/examples.rake"/>

It can be invoked from the command line with:

<pre>
rake examples
</pre>

Also see the "RCov":rcov.html page for info about how to generate a coverage report.

h3. Generate HTML report

<ruby file="../rspec/rake_tasks/failing_examples_with_html.rake"/>

This will write a HTML file that looks like "this":failing_examples.html.
