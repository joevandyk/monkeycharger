h2. Contribute to RSpec

There are several ways in which you can contribute to RSpec. 

h2. Mailing Lists

One easy way you can contribute is to join and participate in our mailing lists:

"http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=797":http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=797

* rspec-users is for anyone who use RSpec to discuss any topics related to
the use of the tools
* rspec-devel is for those interested in the ongoing development of RSpec and
those who wish to make personal contributions

While we don't wish to restrict the content on either list, we do ask that
off topic posts are so marked ([OT] in the subject line).

Also, please use the tracker to submit Requests For Enhancement (see below), not
the mailing lists. While we're happy to engage in conversation about ongoing
development, we're not always available, in town, on line, etc and the best
way to ensure that your concerns stay on our radar is to put them in the
tracker, which we review regularly.

h2. Requests For Enhancement (RFEs)

Please use the tracker for all RFEs.

For Feature Requests, Patches and Bugs, please be sure to select the appropriate
category (expectations, mocks, runner, rails plugin, or RSpec.tmbundle)

"RubyForge tracker":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=797

Wherever feasible, please please please submit a complete spec we can run - something like:

<ruby>
describe "My Problem" do
  it "can be reproduced as follows" do
    # Why doesn't this work?
    # (This is just a silly example)
    true.should be_true
  end
end
</ruby>

This will make us more likely to look at it quickly.

h3. Feature Requests

Interested in a new feature that you would find useful but don't wish
to develop yourself? Please submit it in a Feature Request.

h3. Patches

Interested in a new feature that you've already written or want to write?
Please submit a patch, but please follow these guidelines.

* patch against svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk (do not patch against a released gem)
* include specs!
* include docs!
* run "rake pre_commit" on your patched source
* create a patch with "svn diff > something_rather_descriptive.diff"
* create a new ticket in the "RubyForge tracker":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=797
* attach the diff file to the ticket (DON'T FORGET TO TICK THE CHECKBOX OR YOUR PATCH WILL GET LOST)

%{font-weight:bold; color:red}WARNING:% When you add new files, you have to 'svn add' them before
running pre_commit.

h3. Bugs

We LOVE to hear about bugs that you find, but we can't address them
if we can't reproduce them. If you submit a Bug report, be sure to include:

* rspec version (either a versioned release or svn revision number)
* rails version (if you're using the rspec_on_rails plugin)
* any other relevant versions, OSes, etc
* a failing spec AND code - we need to be able to reproduce the failure. While code snippets are better than nothing, what we really prefer is modifications to RSpec's own specs, as a unified diff file.
