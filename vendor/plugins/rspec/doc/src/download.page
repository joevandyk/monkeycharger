h2. Download

There are several ways to download RSpec. Which way is right for you depends on how you want to use it.

h3. Rubygems

This is the preferred way for non-Rails projects. Non-windows users may have to use sudo. Download the latest with:

<pre>
gem install rspec
</pre>  

or if you want an older version:

<pre>
gem install rspec -v 0.9.4
</pre>  

h3. Ruby on Rails projects

See "Rails":documentation/rails/install.html

h3. Direct download

Get it from "Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=797

h3. Subversion

Check it out:

<pre>
svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk rspec_trunk
</pre>

or

<pre>
svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/{svn_tag: }/rspec rspec_{svn_tag: }
</pre>

See the "README":rdoc/files/README.html for details about how to build it.
