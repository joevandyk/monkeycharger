Sexy Migrations
===============

Sexy migrations.

class SexyRight < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :users do 
      string      :name
      foreign_key :group  # => makes group_id
      timestamps!         # => created_at and updated_at
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :users
  end
end


Pass :ref => true to a foreign_key declaration to make it a real 
foreign key constraint.

  foreign_key :user, :ref => true  # makes fk constraint, references 'users' table

  Also: foreign_keys, fkey, fkeys

Use polymorphic(name) to make polymorphicish id / type columns.

  polymorphic :item # => makes item_id and item_type

  Also: polymorphic!

The timestamps method accepts a list of symbols which it will create
as datetime columns.

  timestamps! :published_at  # => created published_at in addition to 
                             #    created_at and updated_at

  Also: timestamps, auto_dates, auto_dates!

The inheritable method helps you out with STI, a bit.

  inheritable!  # => t.column :type, :string 

  Also: inheritable

And then we've got locking:

  locking! # => t.column :lock_version, :integer, :default => 0

  Also: locking, locks!, locks.
